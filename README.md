Diabetes Prediction System
Overview
The Diabetes Prediction System is a machine learning-based tool that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on key medical data. This system uses a predictive model trained on a healthcare dataset to provide early detection and proactive healthcare recommendations.

Features
Prediction Accuracy: Achieves over 85% accuracy in predicting diabetes using patient data such as age, BMI, glucose levels, and insulin levels.
User-Friendly Interface: Accepts medical data inputs and provides immediate predictions through a simple web interface.
Fast Processing: Delivers prediction results in less than 1 second.
Technologies Used
Machine Learning: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
Web Framework: Flask
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
Database: SQLite (or MySQL, if applicable)
Deployment: Local or cloud-based deployment

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/prathameshatkare/diabestese-prediction.git
cd diabetes-prediction
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset:

Download the diabetes dataset from [insert dataset source] and place it in the data/ directory.
Train the model:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the web interface:

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.
Usage
Enter medical data such as age, BMI, glucose levels, insulin levels, and blood pressure into the web interface.
The system will analyze the data and provide a prediction of whether the patient is at risk of diabetes.
Review the prediction along with a confidence score.
Future Enhancements
Expand the model to include additional features such as family history and lifestyle factors.
Deploy on cloud platforms for broader accessibility.
Integrate with healthcare databases to track patient history and trends.
