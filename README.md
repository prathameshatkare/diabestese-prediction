# Diabetes Prediction System

## Overview
The Diabetes Prediction System is a machine learning-based web tool designed to predict diabetes risk using patient data such as age, BMI, glucose, and insulin levels. It aims to assist in early detection, enabling proactive healthcare.

## Features
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves over 85% accuracy using patient health data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple input form and fast predictions.
- **Quick Processing**: Provides results in less than 1 second.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Database**: SQLite (or MySQL if needed)
- **Deployment**: Local or cloud-based

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prathameshatkare/diabestese-prediction.git
   cd diabestese-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the dataset:**
   - Get the diabetes dataset from [link to dataset] and place it in the `data/` directory.

4. **Train the model:**
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the web interface:**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage
1. Enter medical data (age, BMI, glucose, etc.) in the web form.
2. Receive a diabetes risk prediction along with a confidence score.

## Future Enhancements
- Include additional features (family history, lifestyle).
- Deploy to cloud platforms for broader accessibility.
- Integrate with healthcare systems to track patient data.
